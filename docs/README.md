### System Design Diagrams
For my documentation diagrams and system designs, I used Mermaid which is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify complex diagrams. Mermaid enables users to create easily modifiable diagrams, it can also be made part of production scripts. Refer to mermaid documentation for more information https://mermaid.js.org/intro/
